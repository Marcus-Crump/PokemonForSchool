# Pokemon Remake in C++

This project was inspired by the pong tutorial I had followed.  
That tutorial series taught me some basics for the Win32 API and I am now able to create a window and render simple images to the screen and move them with keyboard input.  
From there, I started to wonder how I could make simple sprites like in some of my favorite games and began to toy around with ideas to render them. 
This project, as of right now is very messy, and it used to be worse. This version here is what I submitted as a final project in my Japanese class, hence why the demo is in Japanese.  
The code itself is in English, and there is an English library in the game as I had started out making the game in English, it's just not used as I have not set it up to be used yet.  
The game is more like a demo, there's not much to do other than open the menu and interact with one npc, and all of this was rushed as I underestimated the amount of work required to make the sprites.  
Oh yeah, the sprites in this demo are really bad.  
I am still a novice when it comes to computer science and this game was my first real venture into making windows software. While I do know some basic data structures, I needed a refresher on pointers and classes in C++ before
