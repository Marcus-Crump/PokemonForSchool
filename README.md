# PokemonForSchool (Demo Project)

## Overview
A Pokémon-themed demo application created for a non-computer science course.
The project was built to demonstrate programming concepts and interactive behavior, not as a production-quality system.

## Context
This codebase was developed under time constraints for a class demonstration.
As a result, it prioritizes visible functionality over structure, efficiency, or maintainability.

## Current State
- Functional demo showcasing basic game-style logic and interaction
- Ad hoc structure and minimal abstraction
- Limited documentation and testing

## Known Issues
- Code organization is inconsistent and not representative of best practices
- Inefficient logic and duplicated code
- Intended refactor/rewrite was never completed

## Status
This project is abandoned.
A full rewrite would be the correct approach rather than incremental cleanup.

## What This Demonstrates
- Ability to rapidly prototype interactive behavior
- Translating abstract requirements into a working demo
- Recognizing when a rewrite is preferable to refactoring a poor initial structure
